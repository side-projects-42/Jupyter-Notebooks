Write a program that reads in this data, asks the user for their zip code, and returns the actual shipping surcharge. Your program should automatically download the shipping data, not copy and paste it into the program. Use comments to explain each major step in your program.\n",

    "- How often do you think this kind of thing happens? What do you think can be done about it?\n",
    "- If your code was going to become part of the shopping cart software, how might you improve your code?"
